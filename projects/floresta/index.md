Located in Panama, Floresta seeks to build a housing construct with a strong sense of community.
{: para}

With this vague-ish project goal in mind - I set foot in branding Floresta.

### Logo Design
{: h3}

First stop - logo design. A logo is one of the most important aspects of branding. Okay, probably *the* most important. 
{: para}

I asked myself a set of questions to get the braincells churning:
{: para}

* Location. What is recognizable and relatable to it's habitants 
* Where will the logo be shown? The side of a billboard? Business cards? On a plaque adorned to a gold encrusted statue?
* Content. Should there be a symbol? Name written out? 
{: para}

Taking each question into consideration (and not taking this writeup into consideration at the time); I ended up with the logo below. 
{: para}

Just kidding, I found two more older renditions.
{:para}

{:img-double: .small-6 .img-double }
![Floresta Red logo rendition](img/red-logo.png){: width="400px" data-featherlight="img/red-logo.png"}
{: img-double}
![Floresta Leaf logo rendition](img/leaf-logo.png){: width="400px" data-featherlight="img/leaf-logo.png"}
{: img-double}



Whoa, 3 colors? [Are you crazy, are you outta your mind?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x8e8QwPofc){: target="_blank"} Yes I chose three colors. These three colors have some significance to the region, well, maybe not great significance but significance nonetheless.

If you've ever been to Latin American, you'd know it's full of stucco finished buildings usually painted in a sun-faded redish pinkish shade. Sometimes there's blue ones, and I imagine green ones, okay, when not painted white. All painted in this once vibrant; now sun faded color scheme. It's beautiful.

### Information Architecture
{: h3}

Information Architecture
 : The organization of a website as it relates to usability and functionality. 
{: para}

I always create an information architecture for any project. I don't *poof\* these site layouts out of nowhere, y'know.
{: para}

To start, I will write questions which a potential site user may ask -- e.g 'What activities can I partake in' or simple ones like 'Where's the location?'. These questions then get sorted into categories containing similar subject matter.From that comes naming the categories ans sub-categories of which the questions fit best in. I may make a blog post on this process in the future. Remind me!

### Wireframes
{: h3}

Our favorite section! Referencing the information architecture, wireframes were created to provide a baseline layout to which I would adhere* my visual design studies to.
{: para}

*used lightly in the case of this project
{: para .tooltip}

{:img-triple: .columns .small-4}
![Wireframe Home](img/wf-home.png){: data-featherlight="img/wf-home.png"}
{: img-triple}

![Wireframe Inner Page](img/wf-inner.png){: data-featherlight="img/wf-inner.png"}
{: img-triple}

![Wireframe mobile](img/wf-mob.png){: data-featherlight="img/wf-mob.png"}
{: img-triple}


### Visual Design
{: h3}

Once my wireframes are approved, the visual design study process begins. Usually, I will create 3 separate designs swapping out typefaces, colors, and minor layout changes in some cases.
{: para}

![Floresta Color Guide](img/vis/colorguide.png){: data-featherlight="img/vis/colorguide.png"}
{: img-wide}

### Design one 
{: .clearfix}
![Floresta Visual Design Home Page design 1](img/vis/home-1.png){: width="460px" data-featherlight="img/vis/home-1.png"}
{: img-double}
![Floresta Visual Design Inner Page design 1](img/vis/main-1.png){: width="460px" data-featherlight="img/vis/main-1.png"}
{: img-double}

### Design two 
{: .clearfix}
![Floresta Visual Design Home Page design 2](img/vis/home-2.png){: width="460px" data-featherlight="img/vis/home-2.png"}
{: img-double}
![Floresta Visual Design Inner Page design 2](img/vis/main-2.png){: width="460px" data-featherlight="img/vis/main-2.png"}
{: img-double}

### Design three 
{: .clearfix}

![Floresta Visual Design Home Page design 3](img/vis/home-3.png){: width="460px" data-featherlight="img/vis/home-3.png"}
{: img-double}
![Floresta Visual Design Inner Page design 3](img/vis/main-3.png){: width="460px" data-featherlight="img/vis/main-3.png"}
{: img-double}

### Final conclusions
{:h3}

Out of the three designs created. I felt that number two was the most visually apealling and provided the best usability. At that point in time, I was sick of sidebars. In fact, I'm still sick of sidebar navigation on home pages.
