### User Profiles

{:tip: .tip .medium-centered .medium-9 .small-12 .large-7}
User profiling is used to determine your most-likely market to cater your services to.
{: tip}

**Example:** Yosij is a second year student attending a small Norwegian university with a focus on a degree in Ecology. He works part-time as a worker in a warehouse for a auto paint company, pulling orders and shipping them to customers. His job pays decently, since he’s still a dependent and doesn’t pay for everything himself.

### Conclusion &amp; Final Outcome
{: h3}

Ivory was an important project for me. Not only because I am proud of my work, but because the subject matter was of importance to me. Designer clothing is one of my favorite things, and having free-reign to create my dream clothing site was very enjoyable.
