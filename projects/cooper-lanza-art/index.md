### Conclusion &amp; Final Outcome
{: h3f}

Cooper Lanza Art was one of my earlier projects and required me to really *think like and artist*. The background-image is something I made in Photoshop [(Here's a giant 3000x3000 wallpaper verson!)](img/lanza-bg-wallpaper.png){:target="_blank"}
{: para}


Overall -- I'm still happy with the outcome, I feel it conveys the langauge of a professional oil painter through pixels. There are things I would change now and redo (such as the mobile design) but overall I'm rather happy. Plus I still use the wallpaper on all of my devices.
