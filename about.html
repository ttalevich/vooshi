    <h3>Who is Vooshi?</h3>
    <p>Vooshi is a real person, named Tracey Talevich. I'm currently living in Seattle, WA <em>aber n√§chste Jahre, ich hoffe zu leben in Berlin.</em> I love any and all types of design! I drink my coffee without sugar.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not sitting in front of my computer, I may be taking a walk, running errands or washing my car. But I'm usually sat in front of my computer, where I learn, create, game, and laugh.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Uh okay, what can you do for me?</h3>
    <p>Good question! Making websites is what I do. From desktop to mobile - my bread and butter skills lie in core Front End Development: <strong>HTML, CSS,</strong> and <strong>Javascript.</strong> I have some experience in PHP and SQL Databases and I am always happy to gain more. User experience and user interface design is one of my favorites as well.</p>
    
    <p>I offer many things, so if you have any questions, please, just <a href="/contact/">ask!</a></p>
