    <h3>Who is Vooshi?</h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm Tracey Talevich, currently living in Seattle, WA where I was born and raised <em>und irgendwann mal, ich hoffe zu leben in Berlin.</em> I love any and all types of design! I drink my coffee without sugar.</p>
    
    <p>Aside from design and development, my hobbies include: working on my car, playing PC games (Overwatch is a current favorite), spending time with those close to me, and working on classwork.</p>
