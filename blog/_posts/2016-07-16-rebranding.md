#### Doc says the results are in  - your site is dead. Actually, hold on, it was never alive.

It's true. I'm not the person who you think I am. [Wait, do you even know me?]({{site.url}}/about/) Anyways, Vooshi is my second venture into the web portfolio world. Shortish story short, my original portfolio website was DOA. Vooshi is a full-assed renvisioning of my portfolio site and blog. This post also serves a timecapsle for Future-Tracey (hopefully I'll be a cyborg once I return). 


## Enter tracey.pw 
{: .mt-l}

I did NO marketing, my SEO wasn't that great. The website is BORING. **Yes, I am shit-talking myself to potential clients or website fans.** It's a wordpress based site, in fact, my *first* wordpress project. <span class="xsm">This is built with Jekyll which I may write about in a future post.</span>

I was getting zero page views, aside from odd bot creeps. Oh and some hits from my teachers. These results weren't intended, but it wasn't a surprise.


Long story short -- I lost motivation and decided a ground-up rebranding was fit. 

Facebook still reigns supreme when searching my name, which is up from number 4. Vooshi will rise to number one. <mark>Mark my words.</mark> Bing actually did better or maybe worse... by putting the .pw as #1

<span class="xsm">Get it, I used a \<mark> tag haha..ha..</span>

I gave up after 20 serch pages of Seattle Web Design. I was getting fierce competition from the Starbucks home page around 15. 

I have been doing something wrong. I know it's not just an SEO issue. My market is **HUGE**, I don't give a rats bum if you're in Budapest or Gliese 581g --- I'm targetting my services to you. 


## Rebrand in motion
{: .mt-l}
<span class="sm">Let's figure out something new</span>

So what's me to do? Sit around and say I have a portfolio of which I prefered no one to [look at](http://tracey.pw){: target="_blank"}? Well yea, apparently. Tracey.pw went live around Late-November last year (2015 for future robots) and hasn't had many changes. 

Vooshi will be my goal site. This isn't just a 'Hey, check out my work site; I plan to write blog posts about to many topics, but largely relating to the webspace--- webspace is a thing, right? My [project]({{site.url}}/projects/) write-ups will be professional-ish and my blog will be more 'Tracey.' Forewarning: I'm a bit of a knob.


Let's see how this goes!
