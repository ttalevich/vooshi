#### UI Kits: Designers designing for designers.

As a relatively unknown mystery designer, I have always wondered what the hell design and UI kits marketed towards designers are for. There are thousands available across the web on sites like [Sketchappsources](http://www.sketchappsources.com/){: target="_blank"} with many free downloads for anyone to use.

My belief is that design is personal. Learning is enrichment. I assume others designers believe the same. Yes, there's money involved for a lot of it and we don't always get the final say but at the end of the day -- we created something using our own ideas.

* Why use them?
* Do they teach?
* What is their main purpose?
* Getting the creative juices flowing?

- We will freaking find out

So why are people flocking to these UI kits geared towards designers? Is it to speed up the workflow? See how these albeit, beautiful, designs were created? Pick and choose components from each? Or just rip off and finish the prototype UI as fast as possible? 


I'm going to name drop a company which I highly respect in the design space - [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/){: target="_blank"}. This sparked my idea for this article with their [Relate UI Kit.](https://www.invisionapp.com/relate){: target="_blank"}

Downloading the 64.4mb .zip file opens to a .sketch file, Montserrat and Chivo typefaces (which you should have installed already, they're outstanding.)

Nice! Invision gives 3 UI designs for a few social-like apps with 15 artboards each. 

*Sidenote:* Anyone ever used an app with a UI like this? I haven't but let's keep going. It's pretty. 

So what is this for? Yes, you have 3 fancy designs right there but then you'll be the 'dude who just copied that Invision kit'. 

Anyways, first I thought I would try editing one of their templates to create my own branded version.

### "I made this" "You made this?" "...I made this"

I decided to 'create' social sharing service for the modern day backpacker -- Packnation --
Okay, I can do better than that... *Globa* - A social network for the modern day backpacker. Yea, let's go with that.

This was a relatively quick process to rebrand, edit, and add relevant features to my UI. But I feel weird saying my UI. <mark>It's not my UI, it's someone else's UI which I edited.</mark> I like what I did, and I could have done more, but there's no warm fuzzy feeling from creating something yourself. An upside is that it was rather quick to edit/create these. Creative juices did flow. 

### Learn by example

Deconstructing someone's works is an interesting way to see their process. Note: process. The project structure of an assumingly professional designer is useful for a beginner to see. Breaking down their vectors and seeing their paths is interesting. 

Yes, okay. Little bits and bobs can be used as design assets for your work. But why? That's the big question here - WHY?

After deconstructing, editing, recreating, conceptualizing and reenvisioning Invision's UI Kit did I learn? No.

Did I have a fun? **Yes.**
